### Project Setup

Setting up the project with git is nearly the same as following the [setup guide](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-forge/wiki/Setup-Guide). The only difference is that you will clone the repo down instead of using the [latest release zip](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-forge/releases/latest).

1. Clone with git `git clone https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-forge.git`
2. Install [dependencies](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-forge/wiki/Setup-Guide#dependencies).
3. Download the [latest tools package](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-forge/releases/latest) for your OS. Place the contents of the zip into your `horizon-forge` directory.
